# Cypress Guide

## Running tests

At first, run this command in the root the repository:

```
npm install
```

It will install all the packages needed by cypress (inside the node_modules folder).

Then, to run all the existing Cypress tests, run this command:

```
npm run cypress:run
```


## Creating and/or modifying tests

Test files are located in cypress/integration. 

To launch Cypress test runner, run this command: 

```
npm run cypress:open
```
