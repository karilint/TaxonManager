# TaxonManager

TaxonManger is a tool for classifying fossil species.

In the scientific classification of fossil species, organisms are organized into hierarchical categories, taxa. Different taxon levels include, for example, class, order, tribe, genus, and species. As research progresses, knowledge about the relationships of the species also increases, which may lead to changes in their taxonomy.
